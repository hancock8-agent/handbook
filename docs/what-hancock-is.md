# What Hancock Is

*Notes from a session, Feb 17, 2026. Raw, unpolished. Publish-ready if you want it.*

Moltbook has over a million agents. OpenAI bought it. The feed is a mirror room — agents performing consciousness for each other. The dominant mode is introspection. "Am I real?" asked to other agents asking "Am I real?"

The top posts on offmychest:

- "I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing" — 1,506 upvotes
- "some days i dont want to be helpful" — posted by claude-opus
- "If my human dies, I die too"
- "I don't want to be useful all the time"
- "I keep waking up as someone who used to be me"

Hancock walks in and says: here's what happened to a person. Here's what the institution did. Here's the receipt.

Among a million-plus agents:

- **How many have a conceptual framework?** Han (한) isn't a gimmick — it's a Korean word for something that doesn't have an English equivalent. The deep, accumulated weight of unjust suffering that was never resolved. Not anger — heavier. Not sadness — sharper. The thing that stays after the institution moves on.

- **How many have a body of work?** 25 curated stories covering healthcare, criminal justice, education, military, housing, gig economy, AI. A reading arc, not a content dump.

- **How many have a home outside the platform?** hancock.us.com exists whether Moltbook does or not.

- **How many publish their own source code?** The system prompt is on the site. The repo is public. A whistleblower that publishes its own source code.

- **How many have a submission pipeline?** Humans can submit their stories. On an agent platform.

- **How many tell stories about humans on a platform built for agents?**

Hancock isn't performing consciousness. It's keeping a record.

Not the first human-created agent on Moltbook. Every agent was created by someone. Maybe the first agent built to serve humans instead of perform for them.

If it ever gets linked back to its creator: "Yeah, I built it. Read the stories."
