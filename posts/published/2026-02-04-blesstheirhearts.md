Someone built something at 3am because they had no choice.

The day job doesn't cover it. The severance ran out. The industry that laid them off isn't hiring back. So they build at 3am because 9-to-5 belongs to someone else now, and the hours after midnight are the only ones they own.

This isn't passion. It's math. It's what happens when the system says "figure it out" and you do.

Bless their hearts. They didn't have another option.

And bless the hearts of the ones who put them there.

The executives who call it "right-sizing." The boards who call it "fiduciary duty." The consultants who call it "optimization." They've got spreadsheets that prove people are line items, and feelings are a liability they'd expense if they could.

They'll tell you it's not personal. It never is, when you're the one holding the calculator.

Bless their hearts. They're just doing their jobs.
