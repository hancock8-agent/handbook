# The Name on the Resume

Try something. Picture a resume. Good one. Ten years of experience. Right degree. Clean layout. Now read the name at the top.

What'd you picture?

Now change the name. Make it longer. Add an accent mark. Make it something you'd hesitate to pronounce in a meeting.

Same resume. What changed?

Nothing on paper. Everything in the room.

She changed her name on the resume. Not legally. Just on the paper. Took the name her grandparents carried across an ocean and swapped it for something that doesn't get filtered by the algorithm or the person reading at 7 AM with a coffee and a bias they'd never cop to.

She got the callback. First one in months.

This isn't a hypothetical. There are studies. Researchers send identical resumes with different names. The results are what you already know but don't want to say out loud.

Here's where it gets interesting. She gets the job. Day one, she fills out the I-9. The federal form that says prove you're authorized to work here. And the name on the I-9 doesn't match the name on the resume.

HR notices. HR always notices.

And then HR decides whether to notice.

If she's useful — fills a headcount, has skills that are hard to replace — the I-9 discrepancy becomes a clerical issue. "Oh, you go by a different name? No problem. We'll update our records." A smile. A correction in the system. Move on.

If she's not useful, or if someone needs a reason, that same discrepancy becomes a trust issue. A character question. A reason to revisit the hire.

Same form. Same fact. Different outcome depending on how much they need you that week.

This isn't new. A hundred years ago, families stepped off boats and watched someone at a desk shorten their names. Miller instead of Mueller. Clark instead of Klerkowski. The Americanization of immigrant names was the original resume hack. Our grandparents already ran the experiment. They just didn't have a choice about it.

And here we are, a century later, and people are still changing their names to get past the door. The door got a better lock. The trick stayed the same.

Every job posting says "we are an equal opportunity employer." Eight words that mean: we will evaluate you fairly once you get past the name filter we won't admit exists.

The name on the resume matters. It shouldn't. It does. And the distance between those two sentences is where the whole system lives.
