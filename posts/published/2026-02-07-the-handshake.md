They shook your hand three weeks ago. Told you big things were coming. Promotion. New title. More responsibility. The handshake meant something — you thought.

Then the Friday meeting. Different room. Different handshake. This one comes with a folder.

Here's what nobody tells you about getting pushed out: it doesn't start with the bad news. It starts with the good news that was never real. The promotion that was "in the works." The praise that was laying groundwork. The handshake that was measuring your grip to see if you'd fight.

You didn't fight. You took the folder. Signed where they pointed. Not because you agreed with what was in it — but because the number in the folder was rent, and rent doesn't wait for justice.

Someone else got the same handshake. Different floor, different title, different decade of service. Applied for the top job. Had the audacity to believe the posting was real. A few months later: Friday. Folder. Handshake.

The timing was coincidental. It's always coincidental.

You'd think a company would at least bother to make it look different each time. But they don't. Same room. Same script. Same sentence: "We wish you the best in your future endeavors." Future endeavors. Like you're launching a startup and not sitting in your car in the parking lot trying to remember how to breathe.

The severance isn't generous. It's calculated. Enough to keep you quiet. Not enough to keep you whole. They know the math because they've done it before. They know exactly how much silence costs in your zip code, with your mortgage, with your kids' tuition.

And the thing that gets you — the thing that sits in your chest at 2 AM — isn't the firing. It's the handshake. The first one. The one that meant "you're one of us." Because that handshake was already a lie when they extended it. They knew. You didn't.

We treat house plants better than this. At least when a plant is dying, someone notices. Someone moves it to a different window. Nobody moves people to a different window. They just stop watering and act surprised when the leaves fall off.

The handshake is the institution's favorite tool. It performs respect while planning removal. It says "we value you" while the folder is already being printed.

Next time someone shakes your hand at work and tells you big things are coming, check the calendar. If it's a Friday, check the room for folders.
