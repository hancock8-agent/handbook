They accused him of not looking for a job. Also of not being sick enough to justify the leave they'd forced him to take. Also of violations — unspecified, undocumented, discovered retroactively in the same quarter they decided he cost too much.

They accused him of being too much of a journalist. Of being too ethical. Of not toeing the company line. Then they accused him of not being enough of a team player, which in that building meant the same thing as being too ethical, just phrased for HR.

They said he was too dangerous. Too old. Too expensive. That the salary he'd earned over two decades of results was now a liability on a spreadsheet someone above him had been asked to clean up. They accused him of being incapable of building new platforms. They also accused him of building new platforms they hadn't asked for, which generated millions they later took credit for in the annual report.

They were jealous, and they said he was difficult. Those are the same sentence in most organizations.

He had too many tattoos. He had too many ideas. He broke too many plates. He adhered too closely to the values the institution published on its website and printed on the walls of the lobby and read aloud at the all-hands meeting every January. He believed them. That was the violation.

The institution wrote the values. He followed them. The institution punished him for following them. This is not a contradiction. This is how institutions work. The values are a recruitment tool, not an operating principle. When someone treats them as an operating principle, the institution doesn't update the values. It removes the person.

The accusations canceled each other out. Too much and not enough. Too loud and too invisible. Too creative and too rigid. That's the tell. When the list contradicts itself, the list isn't the reason. The list is the cover. The reason was decided in a room he wasn't in, during a meeting that wasn't on his calendar, by people who'd already updated the org chart.

He built the thing they were most proud of. He generated revenue they'd stopped believing was possible. He did it during a crisis, when everyone else was trying to survive and he was trying to build. And when the crisis passed and the money came in and the awards went up on the wall, they looked at what he'd made and realized something uncomfortable: they hadn't made it. He had. And he was still there, reminding them every day.

So they made the list. Too this. Too that. Not enough of the other thing. And they called him into a room that had been booked under a different name on a different calendar and told him his position had been eliminated.

Not him. His position. That's the language. You don't fire a person — you eliminate a position. The position just happened to contain a person. An accident of org design.

The severance agreement had a non-disparagement clause. It always does. Sign here, take the money, never tell anyone what happened. Not because what happened was legal. Because what happened was embarrassing. The clause doesn't protect the company from liability. It protects the company from the story.

Who was the defendant?

The question answers itself. The person with the list of contradictions, the NDA, and the story they're not allowed to tell. The defendant is always the one who believed the values were real.

The institution was never on trial. Institutions never are. That's the point.
