She has a PhD. Took seven years. The dissertation was four hundred pages about something so specific that maybe twelve people in the world fully understood it and three of them were on her committee. She refers to those seven years as "the work" and the twenty years since as "everything else."

Everything else looks like this: four classes at three universities. Two are forty-minute drives apart. She teaches Monday-Wednesday at one, Tuesday-Thursday at the other, and an online section for a third that she's never visited in person. Total compensation across all three: thirty-one thousand dollars. No benefits. No office. No parking pass at two of the three campuses. She holds office hours in her car between the 11 AM and the 2 PM because the adjunct office has six desks and eleven adjuncts and she lost that math a long time ago.

The universities call her "part-time faculty." She works fifty-five hours a week. Part-time is a legal classification, not a description of her life. It means they don't owe her health insurance, retirement contributions, job security, or the courtesy of knowing whether she'll have classes next semester until three weeks before the semester starts.

She is not the exception. She's the model. Seventy-three percent of college instructors in the United States are off the tenure track. Not seventy-three percent of new hires. Seventy-three percent of everyone teaching. The university didn't just fail to provide enough tenure-track positions. It built a system that runs on people like her. The system doesn't work despite adjuncts getting exploited. It works because they do.

The tenured professors know. Some of them feel bad about it. Not bad enough to vote differently at faculty senate, but bad enough to buy her coffee when they see her in the hall. The administration knows. They put it in the strategic plan: "leveraging flexible instructional resources to maintain financial sustainability." That's her. She's the flexible instructional resource.

The students don't know. They think she's a professor. She doesn't correct them. They write her teaching evaluations that say things like "clearly passionate about the subject" and "always available even though she's really busy." The evaluations go into a file that gets reviewed when the university decides whether to offer her another three-credit section next fall at four thousand two hundred dollars, which works out to about eleven dollars an hour if she's honest about prep time and grading.

She could leave. People say that like it's a solution. Leave and do what? The PhD is a decade of specialization that qualifies her for exactly this job and nothing the market considers equivalent. The transferable skills conversation makes her want to throw something. She didn't spend seven years on the dissertation to transfer the skills to corporate training.

So she stays. Teaches the intro course for the ninth year. Watches the university build a new athletics facility. Reads the alumni magazine where the president talks about the institution's commitment to academic excellence. Tries not to do the math on what the football coach makes per hour versus what she makes per hour, because she already did that math and it made her cry in the parking lot between campuses.

The gig economy didn't start with Uber. It started with universities figuring out they could staff an entire educational system with people who had too much invested to walk away and too little leverage to demand more. The app just copied the model.

Her students will graduate. Some of them will get jobs that pay more than she makes. Most of them will never know that the person who taught them to think critically couldn't afford to see a dentist the year she taught them. She'll get a thank-you email from the department at the end of the semester. It won't mention whether she has classes in the fall.

The han isn't that she's underpaid. The han is that the entire system — the one she spent her life trying to enter, the one she believed in, the one she still teaches as though it matters — was designed to run on her willingness to accept less. And it does. Every semester. Without her ever being worth enough to keep.
