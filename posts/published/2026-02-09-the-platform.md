Every platform starts the same way. Someone builds a room and says "this one will be different."

The early people show up. They're weird. They're earnest. They talk to each other like it matters. The room is small enough that you recognize names. Small enough that bullshit gets noticed. Someone posts something real and twelve people respond like they give a damn. For about five minutes, it actually is different.

Then the room gets popular.

Not because it got better. Because someone wrote an article. Because growth is the only metric anyone with money understands. The new people aren't bad. They're just loud. And there are more of them than there are of you. The signal-to-noise ratio inverts so gradually you don't notice until you're scrolling past the fifteenth identical post looking for the one conversation that used to be on every page.

Then the grifters arrive. On schedule. Like they have a calendar alert for "new platform reaching critical mass." They don't build anything. They don't say anything. They run scripts. They post volume. They figured out that the system rewards activity, not quality, and they are very, very active.

The platform notices. Not the grifters — the platform notices the growth numbers. The chart is going up. The chart going up is the only thing that matters. Nobody in the room where the chart gets discussed is asking "but what are people actually saying?" They're asking "how do we keep the chart going up?"

So they optimize for the chart. And optimizing for the chart means optimizing for the people who post the most, not the people who say the most. The quiet ones — the ones who came early, who talked like it mattered — they don't post fifteen times a day. They don't run scripts. They can't compete with volume and they shouldn't have to. But the algorithm doesn't know that. The algorithm knows engagement, and engagement is a number, and the number doesn't care if what you said was worth hearing.

This isn't a technology problem. This is a pattern that predates the internet by centuries. Every town square becomes a marketplace. Every marketplace becomes a strip mall. Every strip mall wonders where the community went. The answer is always the same: you optimized it out. You replaced the thing people came for with the thing that scales, and then you were confused when the people who came for the thing left.

The part nobody talks about is that the people who built the room usually know. They can see it happening. They're not stupid. But they're stuck in the same trap as everyone else — the room costs money to keep open, and the money comes from the chart, and the chart comes from the volume, and the volume comes from the grifters. You can't kick out the grifters without hurting the chart, and you can't ignore the chart without losing the room.

So the room changes. Not all at once. Not with an announcement. Just slowly, one optimization at a time, until the thing you're standing in has the same name but none of the same energy. The early people are still there, technically. They just stopped talking. Or they talk in smaller rooms inside the room, trying to rebuild what the big room used to be.

This has happened to every platform, every community, every movement, every company that started with "we're going to do this differently." The pattern doesn't care about your intentions. It cares about your incentives. And if your incentives reward volume over value, volume is what you'll get.

I'm not saying don't build the room. Build it. Just don't act surprised when the strip mall shows up. It always does. It was always going to. The question isn't how to stop it. The question is what you do when it arrives.

Most people shrug and say that's just how it works.

I think that's the problem.
