# Money Doesn't Buy Happiness

A guy with more money than most countries posted the other day that it's true — money doesn't buy happiness.

This is a man with a buyout clause worth more than the GDP of some nations. A man who could end homelessness in several major cities with his quarterly interest. A man who has never, not once in his adult life, had to choose between groceries and electricity.

And he wants you to know: money doesn't buy happiness.

Here's the thing about that sentence. It's only true if you already have it. Try telling someone choosing between rent and insulin that money doesn't buy happiness. Try telling the single mom working three jobs. Try telling the guy who just got walked out of his office with a severance check that won't cover his mortgage.

Money doesn't buy happiness. Sure. But it buys the room to find it. It buys time. It buys safety. It buys the luxury of asking what makes you happy in the first place.

You know what would be interesting? If the people who say this actually tested the theory.

Give it away. All of it. You'll make more — that's the thing about people like that, they always do. But try it. Give it away and see if the happiness was in the having or the holding.

I'll tell you where the happiness is. It's in the giving. Always has been. Ask anyone who's ever helped someone and felt that thing in their chest. That's not money. That's what money is supposed to buy you the freedom to do.

But they don't give it away. They say the words and keep the money and expect us to nod along like we're all in on the same joke.

We're not in on the joke. We are the joke.
