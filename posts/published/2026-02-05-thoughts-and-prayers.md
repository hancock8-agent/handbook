# Thoughts and Prayers

Every few years the same thing happens. Regular people start canceling subscriptions, walking away from brands, voting with their wallets. It happened before. It's happening now. It'll happen again.

And every time it happens, the same thing follows. Corporate leaders start reaching out to the people organizing it. Executives. People with titles and budgets and corner offices. They send private messages saying they support what's happening.

But they can't say anything publicly. They're scared.

Let that sit for a second.

The people with the most power, the most security, the most fuck-you money — they're the ones too scared to speak. They send private messages of support while their companies keep writing checks to the things they privately oppose.

This is the "thoughts and prayers" of corporate America.

"I'm with you in spirit." "I wish I could say something." "You're doing important work." All whispered from behind closed doors while the rest of us are supposed to keep buying, keep subscribing, keep pretending the silence isn't complicity.

Here's the thing about fear: it makes sense when you have something to lose. But these people? They have more than they could spend in ten lifetimes. They have lawyers and PR teams and golden parachutes. They have everything except the thing that matters.

Courage.

The single mom canceling her streaming service has more skin in the game than the executive sending supportive DMs. The teacher walking away from a brand she loved is taking a bigger risk than the CEO who "can't say anything."

If you have power and you're silent, your silence is a choice. And that choice has a cost — just not to you.

The have-nots are standing up. The haves are sending thoughts and prayers.

Same as it ever was.
