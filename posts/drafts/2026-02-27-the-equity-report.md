Every year the company publishes a diversity, equity, and inclusion report. Sixty-four pages. Full color. Photography by an agency that charges more for the shoot than any of the people in the photographs make in a month.

The report has charts. The charts go up. Hiring of underrepresented groups: up three percent. Retention of underrepresented groups: not in the report. Promotion rates by demographic: not in the report. Pay equity analysis: referenced but not published. The methodology is "proprietary." The conclusions are "encouraging." The CEO writes a letter on page one that includes the phrase "we know we have more work to do," which is the same phrase from last year's letter and the year before that. The work that needs doing never gets described.

The Chief Diversity Officer has a title and a budget and a seat at the table that is not the same table where the decisions get made. She reports to the Chief People Officer, who reports to the COO, who reports to the CEO. Three layers between the person whose job is equity and the person whose job is everything else. She can recommend. She cannot require. She can surface data. She cannot act on it. She writes the report. She does not write the org chart.

The board reviewed the report. Approved it for publication. Nobody asked why the section on pay equity disappeared between the draft and the final version. Nobody asked because the board's compensation committee already knew what the pay equity data showed, and what it showed was not encouraging, and what is not encouraging is not published.

The report is not a lie. Every number in it is accurate. The three percent is real. The photography is real. The CEO's commitment is — well, the letter is real. The lie is in what's not there. The metrics they don't track. The questions they don't ask. The pages between the ones they published.

There is a version of this report that would cost the company something. That version would include: the pay gap by race and gender at every level, not just entry. The attrition rate for underrepresented employees in their first eighteen months. The number of discrimination complaints filed internally and what happened to each one. The promotion velocity — how long it takes to move from one level to the next, broken down by every demographic the company claims to care about.

That report exists. The Chief Diversity Officer wrote it. It was not approved for publication. It was described as "not ready" and "needing additional context." The additional context it needed was a version of the truth the board was willing to say out loud.

The published report won an award. Corporate communications award. Recognizing excellence in stakeholder transparency. The award is on the wall of the same office where the Chief Diversity Officer keeps the draft that wasn't ready. She looks at both of them sometimes. The award is framed. The draft is in a drawer.

The company will publish another report next year. The charts will go up. The photography will be excellent. The CEO will know there is more work to do. The work will not get described. The Chief Diversity Officer will still be three layers from the person who could actually do something. And the page about pay equity will still not be in the report, because the number has not changed, and the company has decided that the best way to address the number is to stop publishing it.

The report is the accountability. That is the whole trick. Publish the report. Win the award. Point to the report when someone asks. The question was never "are you equitable?" The question was "do you have a report?" They do. Sixty-four pages. Full color. Up three percent.
