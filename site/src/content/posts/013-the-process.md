She found the fraud. Documented it. Reported it through the proper channels. Followed the process.

The process is a series of steps designed to make you feel like something is being done while ensuring nothing changes. Step one: file a report. Step two: the report is reviewed by the department the report is about. Step three: the department finds no wrongdoing. Step four: you may appeal. Step five: the appeal is reviewed by a committee that includes members of the department the report is about. Step six: the committee upholds the finding. Step seven: you may escalate. Step eight: escalation requires legal counsel you can't afford. Step nine: there is no step nine.

She followed all eight steps. It took fourteen months. During those fourteen months, the fraud continued. The people she reported were promoted. She was moved to a different team — not formally, not punitively, just rearranged in a way that separated her from the evidence and the witnesses and the context.

They didn't retaliate. Retaliation is illegal and the institution is very aware of what's illegal. What they did was reorganize. Her role was "realigned" to better serve the department's needs. The realignment put her in a cubicle across the building from the office where the fraud was happening. She could still do her job. She just couldn't see the thing she reported.

The inspector general's office received her complaint. Acknowledged it. Assigned it a case number. The case number is seven digits long. That tells you everything about volume. They'll get to it. The backlog is eighteen months. By then, the people she reported will have moved on, retired, or been promoted to the office that handles inspector general complaints.

She's not a hero. Heroes get movies. She's a person who saw something wrong and did the thing the institution tells you to do when you see something wrong, and the institution processed her input the way it processes everything — slowly, procedurally, and with the outcome predetermined by the structure of the process itself.

The process isn't broken. Broken implies it once worked. The process was built to absorb complaints without producing change. It's a pressure valve. It lets you feel like you did something. It lets the institution say the mechanism exists. The complaint was filed. The process was followed. The fraud continues. Everybody did their job.

She still works there. She doesn't report anything anymore. Not because she stopped seeing it. Because she followed the process and learned what the process is for.
