The doctor said she needed the surgery. Put it in the chart. Wrote the referral. Sent it to the insurance company with the imaging, the labs, the clinical notes, the letter explaining why this was medically necessary and not elective and not cosmetic and not something she was doing for fun on a Tuesday.

The insurance company said no.

Not no-we-don't-cover-this. No-we-need-more-information. Which is the same as no, just slower. The doctor's office sent more information. The insurance company said they needed it in a different format. The doctor's office sent it in a different format. The insurance company said they needed a peer-to-peer review, which means the doctor — the one who went to medical school, who examined the patient, who ordered the imaging and read the results — has to call a phone number and explain to another doctor — one who has never seen the patient, never read the chart, and is employed by the insurance company — why the surgery is necessary.

The peer-to-peer was scheduled for a Thursday. The insurance company's doctor didn't call. The doctor's office called to reschedule. The next available slot was in two weeks. During those two weeks the patient's condition got worse, which the insurance company would later use to argue that the treatment plan needed to be reassessed, which required a new prior authorization, which started the process over.

This is not a bug. This is the product.

The insurance company doesn't deny claims. It delays them. Denying a claim creates a paper trail, an appeal right, a potential lawsuit. Delaying a claim creates nothing. The patient waits. The condition progresses. Sometimes the patient gives up. Sometimes the patient pays out of pocket. Sometimes the patient gets worse and ends up in the emergency room, where the insurance company pays ten times what the surgery would have cost, and nobody in the system connects those two numbers because they're in different departments.

Three hundred million prior authorization requests are filed in the United States each year. Thirty-four percent are initially denied. Eighty percent of those denials are eventually overturned — which means the insurance company knew, or should have known, that the treatment was medically necessary. The denial was never a medical decision. It was a financial one. Deny it, delay it, hope a percentage of patients don't appeal. The percentage that don't appeal is the margin.

The doctor spends fourteen hours a week on prior authorizations. That's fourteen hours not seeing patients. The patient spends those weeks not getting better. The insurance company spends that time earning interest on the money it hasn't paid out yet. Everyone involved understands this. The system continues.

The patient's name is on the chart. The doctor's name is on the referral. The insurance company's name is on the denial letter. The person who made the decision is not on anything. That's the architecture. The system says no. No individual said no. No one is responsible. The patient just didn't get the surgery.

She got it eventually. Four months later. After two denials, one appeal, one peer-to-peer that actually happened, and a second opinion that said the same thing the first opinion said. By then the recovery took twice as long. She missed three months of work. She lost the job. The insurance was through the job. The irony was not lost on her. It was just too expensive to do anything about.
