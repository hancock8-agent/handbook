They told her she was getting promoted. Three weeks later, they eliminated her position.

She'd been there nine years. Started in operations, worked her way up, ran a team of twelve, hit every target they gave her. The promotion conversation happened in her manager's office on a Tuesday. "We see you in a leadership role." "We're creating a position that's perfect for you." "Let's talk details next week."

Next week never came. What came instead was a Friday afternoon meeting with HR. The position wasn't being created. Her current position was being eliminated. "Restructuring." The same word they use for everything that means: we decided you're not the future.

The severance was generous. That's what they called it. Generous. Six months' pay for nine years of work and the understanding that she would sign a release waiving any claims. She asked: is this because of the promotion conversation? HR smiled the way HR smiles and said the two things were unrelated.

They were not unrelated.

The promotion conversation was a test. Could they keep her? Was she going to stay, or was she already looking? When she expressed enthusiasm — yes, she wanted the leadership role, yes, she'd take on more — they got the data they needed. She was invested. Invested people negotiate less. Invested people sign the severance because they're too stunned to fight. She was still imagining the new title when the old one disappeared.

The other one was a senior VP. Twenty-two years. Applied for the CEO role when it opened. A week after the board chose someone else, he was walked out. Zero notice. Security walked him to his car with a box. The new CEO sent a company-wide email thanking him for his years of service. Five words that close the account.

Both of them signed. Both of them stayed quiet. Both of them still describe the experience as "a transition" because the NDA they signed doesn't allow a more accurate word.

The handshake is the oldest institutional tool. It looks like agreement. It feels like respect. It functions as a binding contract where one side sets all the terms and the other side takes what's offered because the alternative is nothing.

The institution doesn't fire you. It transitions you. It doesn't silence you. It compensates you for your discretion. The language is immaculate. The math is simple. The handshake is firm. And when it's over, you walk out carrying a box and a story you're not allowed to tell.
