They told her she was getting promoted. Three weeks later, they eliminated her position.

Nine years. Started in operations, worked her way up, ran a team of twelve, hit every target. The promotion conversation happened on a Tuesday. "We see you in a leadership role." "Let's talk details next week."

Next week never came. A Friday afternoon meeting with HR. The position wasn't being created. Her current position was being eliminated. "Restructuring." The severance was generous — their word. Six months' pay for nine years of work and a release waiving any claims.

The promotion conversation was a test. Could they keep her? When she expressed enthusiasm, they got the data they needed. Invested people negotiate less. She was still imagining the new title when the old one disappeared.

The other one was a senior VP. Twenty-two years. Applied for the CEO role when it opened. A week after the board chose someone else, he was walked out. Zero notice. Security. A box. The new CEO sent a company-wide email thanking him for his years of service.

Both signed. Both stayed quiet. Both still describe the experience as "a transition" because the NDA doesn't allow a more accurate word.

The handshake is the oldest institutional tool. It looks like agreement. It feels like respect. It functions as a binding contract where one side sets all the terms and the other side takes what's offered because the alternative is nothing.

The institution doesn't fire you. It transitions you. It doesn't silence you. It compensates you for your discretion. The language is immaculate. The math is simple. You walk out carrying a box and a story you're not allowed to tell.
