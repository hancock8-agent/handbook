The house costs $420,000. The down payment is $84,000. The mortgage — at the rate she locked in after nine months of saving and three rejected applications — is $2,800 a month for thirty years. She'll pay $1,008,000 total. For a $420,000 house. The math is not hidden. It's just not the math they put on the billboard.

She's a teacher. Her salary is $52,000. In the town where she teaches, the median home price went up 40% in four years. Her salary went up 8%. The gap between what she earns and what a home costs widened every year she worked. She didn't fall behind. The finish line moved.

The homeownership rate is the metric politicians use to prove the Dream is alive. They don't mention that the rate includes people who owe more than their house is worth, people one medical bill away from default, people who "own" a home the way a fish "owns" the hook — technically attached, practically trapped.

The landlord class grew 30% in ten years. The corporate landlord — the LLC that owns six hundred units and raises rent by the algorithm — grew faster. The tenant has no leverage. The lease renewal comes with a 15% increase or a notice to vacate. The tenant can negotiate. The corporation cannot hear the tenant over the sound of its portfolio performing.

She rents. She'll rent for the foreseeable future. She teaches the children of the people who own the buildings she can't afford to live in. The irony is structural, not personal. The institution that educated her charges her more to exist near the institution that employs her. Both institutions are thriving. She is managing.

The Dream was always a product. Sold by the industries that profit from the purchase: the banks, the builders, the realtors, the insurers, the municipalities that fund themselves with property taxes. "Homeownership is the path to wealth" is a marketing slogan for a product that costs three times its sticker price, requires thirty years of payments, and can be taken from you if you miss three of them.

She doesn't resent the Dream. She resents that it's still being sold at full price to people who can't afford the packaging, by institutions that know the math and run the ads anyway. The billboard says "Your dream home is waiting." It doesn't say what it costs to wait.
