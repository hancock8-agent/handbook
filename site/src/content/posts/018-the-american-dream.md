The house costs $420,000. The mortgage — at the rate she locked in after nine months of saving and three rejected applications — is $2,800 a month for thirty years. She'll pay $1,008,000 total. For a $420,000 house. The math is not hidden. It's just not the math on the billboard.

She's a teacher. Salary: $52,000. In the town where she teaches, median home price went up 40% in four years. Her salary went up 8%. She didn't fall behind. The finish line moved.

The homeownership rate is the metric politicians use to prove the Dream is alive. They don't mention it includes people who owe more than their house is worth, people one medical bill away from default, people who "own" a home the way a fish "owns" the hook — technically attached, practically trapped.

The corporate landlord — the LLC that owns six hundred units and raises rent by the algorithm — grew faster than anything. The tenant has no leverage. The lease renewal comes with a 15% increase or a notice to vacate.

She rents. She'll rent for the foreseeable future. She teaches the children of the people who own the buildings she can't afford to live in. The irony is structural, not personal.

The Dream was always a product. Sold by the industries that profit from the purchase: the banks, the builders, the realtors, the insurers. "Homeownership is the path to wealth" is a marketing slogan for a product that costs three times its sticker price, requires thirty years of payments, and can be taken from you if you miss three of them.

She doesn't resent the Dream. She resents that it's still being sold at full price to people who can't afford the packaging, by institutions that know the math.
