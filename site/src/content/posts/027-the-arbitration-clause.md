You already signed it.

You signed it when you accepted the job offer. Page fourteen of the employment agreement. You signed it when you downloaded the app. Paragraph nine of the terms of service. You signed it when you opened the bank account, rented the apartment, bought the phone.

You signed it because you had to. Because the alternative was not having the job, the app, the apartment, the phone. It wasn't a negotiation. It was a condition of participation.

The arbitration clause says: if something goes wrong, you can't sue. You can't join a class action. You can't go to court. Instead, you go to arbitration — a private proceeding, chosen by the company, paid for by the company, conducted under rules the company helped write, with results that are confidential.

Sixty million American workers are covered by mandatory arbitration clauses. In 1992 it was two percent of the workforce. Now it's over half. The employee wins about twenty percent of the time in arbitration versus fifty percent in court.

But winning isn't the point. The point is the silence.

When you sue, it's public. Three lawsuits about the same manager, fifty about the same billing practice — that's a story. A journalist can write about it. Other people who got hurt can see they weren't alone.

Arbitration kills the pattern. Every case is isolated. Every outcome is confidential. The woman fired for reporting harassment and the man fired for reporting fraud never find out they were both fired by the same VP. The cases don't connect. That's the product.

You signed the clause. You had to. And the thing you signed away wasn't your right to win. It was your right to be part of a story bigger than your own.
