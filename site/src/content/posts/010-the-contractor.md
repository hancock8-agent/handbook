You're not an employee. That's the first thing they tell you. The second thing they tell you is everything an employee would be told: where to sit, when to work, what to wear, who to report to, what tools to use, which meetings to attend.

The difference is what they don't tell you. They don't tell you about the health insurance because you don't get it. They don't tell you about the 401k match because there isn't one. They don't tell you about the paid time off because if you don't work, you don't get paid. They don't tell you about the severance because contractors don't get severed — they get "not renewed."

You're not an employee. You're a line item. A variable cost instead of a fixed one. The company reports headcount to investors and you're not in it. When they say "we have 500 people," they mean 500 employees. The 200 contractors who do the same work in the same building don't count. That's the feature. You're invisible in the metric that matters.

The work is the same. Sometimes you do more because you know you're replaceable and the employee next to you knows they're not. You both pretend the arrangement is temporary. The company calls it "flexible staffing." You call it a gig while you wait for the conversion that's always six months away.

Some people choose this. Some people are chosen for it. The distinction matters less than you'd think because the institution doesn't see the difference. You're a contractor because someone decided you should be, and the decision was made in a spreadsheet, not a conversation.

The gig economy language makes it sound like freedom. Be your own boss. Set your own hours. Work from anywhere. The translation: no benefits, no security, no floor. The freedom to work whenever you want as long as it's whenever they need you. The freedom to go somewhere else as long as somewhere else is doing the same thing for the same non-rate with the same non-benefits.

The driver who delivers your groceries is a contractor. The nurse filling a staffing shortage is a contractor. The engineer building the feature is a contractor. The teacher covering the unfilled position is a contractor. The pattern is the same everywhere: the institution needs the work done but doesn't want the worker on the books. So it invents a category that gets the labor without the obligation and calls it flexibility.

You're not an employee. You do the work of one, sit at the desk of one, follow the rules of one, and get the protections of none. But you're flexible. The institution is very clear about that.
