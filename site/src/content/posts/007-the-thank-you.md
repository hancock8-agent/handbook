Thank you for your service.

Five words. A bumper sticker, a handshake at the airport, a discount at the hardware store on Veterans Day. The words cost nothing. That's the point.

He served two tours. Came back with a knee that doesn't work right and a head that works differently than it used to. Filed a disability claim. The VA said it would take four to six months. That was eleven months ago. The letter he got last week said his claim was "pending further review." Nobody can tell him what further review means. The number he calls puts him on hold for forty minutes and then transfers him to a voicemail that doesn't call back.

His congressman put a flag in the yard and posted about "our brave men and women" on Memorial Day. His congressman voted against the VA budget expansion that would have hired the people who process the claims that are pending further review. Both things are true. Neither one is a contradiction in the system. They're features.

The institution says thank you. The institution means: we acknowledge that you did something and we would prefer not to discuss the cost. Thank you is a receipt, not a debt. Thank you is the moment the transaction closes. You served. We thanked you. The account is settled.

Except his knee still doesn't work. And the nightmares still come. And the claim is still pending. And the institution that sent him has moved on to the next budget cycle, the next conflict, the next round of brave men and women who will get the same five words and the same eleven-month wait.

His wife works two jobs. Not because they're poor — his pension is decent. But the medical bills for the things the VA hasn't gotten around to covering yet don't wait for further review. She doesn't talk about it. Not because she's strong. Because nobody asks. "Thank you for your service" is directed at the person who served. The family that absorbed the cost of the service doesn't even get the bumper sticker.

Here's the pattern: the institution that asks the most gives back the least, and fills the gap with language. Thank you for your service. We don't take this decision lightly. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten. These are not lies. They're worse than lies. They're true statements that function as closings. Each one is a door being shut with a smile on the other side.

He doesn't want thanks. He wants his knee fixed and his claim processed and someone to answer the phone. But those things cost money. The words are free.
