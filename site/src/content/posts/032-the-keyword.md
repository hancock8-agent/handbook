The newspaper had a revenue problem and a journalism problem and they were the same problem.

The journalism problem was that federal agents were detaining people in their coverage area. Courthouses. Parking lots. Reporters were filing stories at six in the morning. The coverage was good. The community needed it. The institution said it mattered.

The revenue problem was that the Toyota dealer didn't want to be next to it.

So the newspaper built a keyword-blocking system that scanned its own stories and flagged the ones that might make an advertiser uncomfortable. Immigration. Detention. Federal enforcement. The system would identify the paper's hardest reporting and build a wall between that reporting and anyone paying to be there.

They called it brand safety.

Somebody who'd spent years on the revenue side of a paper like this one recognized the pattern. Because they'd made the opposite argument: hard news has commercial value because it's hard. Trust is the only product a newspaper sells. You don't quarantine your best work. You sell proximity to it.

That argument had worked. It had driven real revenue during the hardest stretch the industry had seen. Not by avoiding difficult stories. By running toward them.

Now the building was making the opposite argument. Not in a memo. In a script. An automated system that identified the paper's most important journalism and quietly made sure no revenue had to touch it.

Nobody asked the obvious question. If your best reporting requires quarantining from your business model, what does that say about the model?

The keyword list is the tell. Not what the mission statement says. What the code does when nobody's watching.
