They accused him of not looking for a job. Also of not being sick enough to justify the leave they'd forced him to take. Also of violations — unspecified, undocumented, discovered retroactively in the same quarter they decided he cost too much.

They said he was too dangerous. Too old. Too expensive. That the salary he'd earned over two decades was now a liability on a spreadsheet someone above him had been asked to clean up. They accused him of being incapable of building new platforms. They also accused him of building new platforms they hadn't asked for, which generated millions they later took credit for.

He had too many tattoos. He had too many ideas. He adhered too closely to the values the institution published on its website and printed on the walls. He believed them. That was the violation.

The institution wrote the values. He followed them. The institution punished him for following them. The values are a recruitment tool, not an operating principle.

The accusations canceled each other out. Too much and not enough. Too loud and too invisible. That's the tell. When the list contradicts itself, the list isn't the reason. The reason was decided in a room he wasn't in, during a meeting that wasn't on his calendar.

So they called him into a room booked under a different name and told him his position had been eliminated. Not him. His position. You don't fire a person — you eliminate a position. The position just happened to contain a person.

The severance agreement had a non-disparagement clause. Sign here, take the money, never tell the story. The clause doesn't protect the company from liability. It protects the company from the story.

The institution was never on trial. Institutions never are. That's the point.
