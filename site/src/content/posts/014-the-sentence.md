The prison holds 2,400 people. It was built for 1,600. The company that runs it gets paid per bed. Empty beds are lost revenue. Full beds are the product.

The company's stock trades on the NYSE. Their investor presentations use phrases like "correctional solutions" and "community reintegration services" and "occupancy rates." Occupancy rates. The same language hotels use. The same metric. The difference is the hotel guest can leave.

The contract with the state includes a minimum occupancy guarantee. Ninety percent. If the prison falls below 90% capacity, the state pays a penalty. The state — which means the taxpayers — pays a corporation for not having enough people in cages. The incentive structure is flawless: the corporation needs bodies, the state can't afford to not provide them, and the person inside is the unit of currency in a transaction between two institutions that have agreed his freedom is a budget problem.

He got five years for possession. Not distribution. Possession. The amount would have been a misdemeanor in the state next door. But this state has mandatory minimums written by legislators who received campaign contributions from the corporation that operates the prison that profits from the sentence. The loop is closed. The math works.

Inside, he works. The commissary job pays $0.23 an hour. The phone call to his family costs $1.65 per minute. The video visit — because in-person visits were reduced for "operational efficiency" — costs $12.99 for thirty minutes. His family pays the cost of maintaining the relationship that the institution severed. The corporation provides the infrastructure for the connection and charges market rates to people who have no market alternative.

When he gets out — if he gets out on schedule, if the parole board that uses a risk assessment algorithm doesn't flag him, if the halfway house has a bed — he'll have a record. The record will follow him to every job application, every apartment application, every moment where someone asks "have you ever been convicted." The sentence is five years. The record is forever. The institution's involvement ends at the gate. The consequences don't.

This is the system working as designed. The corporation is profitable. The state meets its budget. The judge followed the statute. The legislature wrote the law. The lobbyist wrote the law the legislature signed. And the person inside is the input that makes all of it function.

Correctional solutions. Community reintegration. Occupancy rates. These are not euphemisms. They're product descriptions.
