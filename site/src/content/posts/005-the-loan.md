He graduated in 2009. The degree cost $87,000. He's paid $94,000 so far. He still owes $71,000.

That's not a typo. He's paid more than the original amount and the balance went up. The interest accrued while he was in school. It capitalized when he graduated. It compounded while he was making minimum payments during the years the degree wasn't worth what they told him it would be.

The institution that sold him the degree has a $2 billion endowment. They invested it well. His payments are part of the return.

He was seventeen when he signed. Seventeen. A minor. Couldn't rent a car, couldn't buy a beer, couldn't sign a lease. But he could commit to $87,000 of non-dischargeable debt that would follow him until it was paid or he was dead. A bankruptcy judge can clear a gambling debt. A medical debt. A business loan that went sideways. But not this. Student loans survive bankruptcy because Congress made sure they would. The lending industry wrote that provision and Congress signed it, and now a seventeen-year-old's signature is more binding than a mortgage.

He works in the field he studied. Makes decent money. Not what the brochure promised — the brochure had median salaries that included the three people per class who went to Goldman Sachs — but decent. After rent, after the loan payment, after the insurance premium that's too high because he's on the marketplace because his employer classified him as a contractor, he has about $400 a month for everything else. He's thirty-four.

His parents told him the degree was the way. Their parents told them. The system confirmed it at every stage: the guidance counselor, the admissions office, the financial aid officer who explained the loan documents with the same warmth and thoroughness as a flight attendant demonstrating the seatbelt.

The institution didn't lie. The brochure didn't technically lie. The loan documents didn't lie. Everything was accurate in the way that a nutrition label on a candy bar is accurate. All the information was there. The conclusion you were supposed to draw was not.

He'll finish paying when he's fifty-one. The degree will be forty years old. The field will have changed three times. The institution will have raised tuition twice more. And the next seventeen-year-old will sign the same document and believe the same brochure because the institution that sells the dream is also the one that defines what dreaming costs.
