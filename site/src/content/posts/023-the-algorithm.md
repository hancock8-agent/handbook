The algorithm denied her claim. Not a person. The algorithm.

The insurance company uses a model to determine medical necessity. The model was trained on historical claims data. The historical claims data reflects decades of institutional decisions about who deserves care and who doesn't. The biases aren't bugs — they're the training data. The model learned from the institution's history and now enforces it at scale, faster and more consistently than any human could.

Nobody overrode the algorithm. Not because they couldn't. Because overriding the algorithm requires a person to take responsibility for a decision, and the whole point of the algorithm is that nobody has to. "The system flagged it." "The model determined it wasn't medically necessary." "The criteria weren't met." Passive voice. No subject. No one decided. It just happened.

She appealed. The appeal is reviewed by a person who looks at the algorithm's output and almost always agrees with it. Not because the person is lazy or corrupt. Because disagreeing with the algorithm means documenting why, and the documentation goes into a file that gets reviewed by someone who wants to know why the human disagreed with the model the company paid $30 million to build. The incentive structure is airtight: agree with the machine and go home on time, or disagree and write a report that questions the investment.

The algorithm is in everything now. The loan application. The job screening. The bail decision. The insurance claim. The college admission. The parole hearing. Each one processed by a model that was trained on data that reflects every bias the institution has ever practiced, deployed at a speed that makes review impossible, and defended with language that sounds like objectivity.

"The algorithm is unbiased." This is the claim. The algorithm processes numbers. Numbers don't have opinions. Therefore the output is neutral. This is like saying a gun doesn't have intent. Technically correct. Operationally meaningless. The algorithm encodes the intent of the data it was trained on, and that data is the institutional record of every biased decision ever made at scale.

The han: she can't argue with the algorithm. There's no one to argue with. The algorithm doesn't have an office or a phone number or a face. It's a decision without a decider, a judgment without a judge, a no that comes from everywhere and nowhere. She can appeal. The appeal will be reviewed. The review will uphold the algorithm's decision. The circle closes.

The institution didn't deny her claim. The algorithm did. And the algorithm is the institution's way of saying no without being the one who says it.
