He's fifty-seven. Twenty-five years of experience. The résumé is two pages of things he actually did — not managed, not oversaw, did. Built the team. Launched the product. Generated the revenue. Survived four restructurings and two mergers and one CEO who lasted eight months.

The ATS rejected him in eleven seconds. The algorithm parsed his résumé, scored it against the job description, and decided he wasn't a match. Not because he couldn't do the job. Because he used the wrong keywords. Because his title at the last company was "Director" and the system was looking for "Senior Manager." Because his graduation date was 1991 and the model has opinions about that.

He doesn't know this. What he knows is that he applied to forty-seven jobs in three months and got two responses. Both were automated. One said "we've decided to move forward with other candidates." The other said nothing — just silence, which in the job market means the same thing but with less effort.

The recruiters who do respond say variations of the same thing. "You're overqualified." "We're looking for someone earlier in their career." "The compensation range might not align with your expectations." These are all ways of saying: you cost too much because you've been alive too long. But nobody can say that, so they've developed a vocabulary of deflection that communicates age without mentioning it.

He rewrote the résumé. Removed the early jobs. Changed the graduation date to just the degree. Shortened the timeline. Made twenty-five years look like fifteen. The interview rate went up. So did the dissonance. He is now performing a version of himself that doesn't exist — a person with his skills but not his history, his knowledge but not his age, his capability but not the salary expectations that come from three decades of being capable.

The institution says it values experience. The institution's hiring algorithm filters out experience. Both statements coexist without conflict because the institution doesn't experience contradiction — it processes inputs.

The han: he built things that still exist. Products people use. Teams that grew into departments. Revenue that funded the stock price that made the executives rich. None of that is in the algorithm. The algorithm sees a graduation date and a title mismatch and a compensation estimate and returns: not a match.

He's fifty-seven. He has a quarter century of proof that he can do the job. The machine took eleven seconds to decide he can't. He's not angry. He's tired. And tired is worse, because angry fights back and tired just stops trying.
