"I did the best I could."

Five words that close every family argument that never should have been an argument. Five words that mean: I acknowledge something went wrong and I am declining to examine what.

The parent who worked eighty hours a week and missed every recital, every game, every conversation that wasn't about logistics. The parent who chose the career over the kid and then retired and wanted the relationship they never built. The parent who repeated the exact pattern their parent used — the silence, the distance, the conditional love that felt like a test you couldn't study for — and defended it as tradition.

It's not a lie. That's what makes it heavy. They probably did do the best they could. Within the constraints they set. Within the priorities they chose. Within the version of themselves they decided was adequate. The best they could wasn't a lie — it was a ceiling they never tried to raise.

The kid absorbs the gap between what they needed and what they got and carries it into every relationship, every job, every moment where someone's approval matters too much or too little. The kid becomes an adult who either repeats the pattern or spends decades trying not to. Both options are exhausting.

This isn't about bad parents. Bad parents are easy to identify. This is about adequate parents. The ones who showed up. Who provided. Who did the thing that looks like parenting from the outside and missed the thing that matters from the inside: the presence that says you're worth paying attention to even when there's nothing to fix.

"I did the best I could" is the family version of "we don't take this decision lightly." It sounds like accountability. It functions as a closing.
