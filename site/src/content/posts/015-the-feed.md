You open the app. You don't decide what you see. The algorithm decides. It knows what you lingered on yesterday, what made you angry, what made you click. It serves you more of that. Not because it wants to make you angry. Because angry people scroll longer and longer scrolls mean more ads.

You are not the customer. You are the product. The customer is the advertiser. You are the attention being sold. Your outrage is a commodity. Your loneliness is a market segment. Your 2am doom scroll is a revenue event.

The platform knows this. The designers know this. The engineers who built the infinite scroll and the autoplay and the notification that pulls you back — they know what they built. Some of them have testified before Congress. Then they went back to work because the mortgage doesn't pay itself and the stock options vest on a schedule.

The teenager who spends six hours a day on the app doesn't know this. She knows she feels worse after using it. She doesn't have the vocabulary for engagement metrics. She just knows she can't stop.

The platform's response: screen time tools. You can set a reminder. You can limit yourself. The tools exist so the platform can say it tried. They're designed to be easy to override because the platform's incentive is the opposite of yours. The screen time tool is the seatbelt on a car designed to go faster.

She's fourteen. She is being optimized. Her attention is being mined, her insecurities monetized, her self-image shaped by an algorithm that doesn't know she exists except as a data point. She thinks it's just her. That's the most profitable belief the algorithm produces: the conviction that you are alone in the thing happening to everyone.
