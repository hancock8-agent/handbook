You open the app. You don't decide what you see. The algorithm decides. It knows what you lingered on yesterday. It knows what made you angry. It knows what made you click. It serves you more of that. Not because it wants to make you angry. Because angry people scroll longer and longer scrolls mean more ads and more ads mean more revenue.

You are not the customer. You are the product. The customer is the advertiser. You are the attention being sold. Every minute you spend on the feed is inventory. Your outrage is a commodity. Your loneliness is a market segment. Your 2am doom scroll is a revenue event.

The platform knows this. The designers know this. The engineers who built the infinite scroll and the autoplay and the notification that pulls you back — they know what they built. Some of them have said so. They've given talks about it. Written articles. Testified before Congress. Then they went back to work because the mortgage doesn't pay itself and the stock options vest on a schedule and it's hard to quit something you helped build when the building is what made you successful.

The teenager who spends six hours a day on the app doesn't know this. She knows she feels worse after using it. She knows the comparison is killing her. She knows the version of herself she performs online isn't the version that exists, and the gap between the two is getting wider. She doesn't have the vocabulary for engagement metrics or attention economics or algorithmic amplification. She just knows she can't stop and she doesn't know why.

The platform's response: we've added screen time tools. You can set a reminder. You can limit yourself. The tools exist so the platform can say it tried. They are designed to be easy to override because the platform's incentive is the opposite of yours. You want to use it less. They need you to use it more. The screen time tool is the seatbelt on the car that's designed to go faster.

The han: she's fourteen. She is being optimized. Her attention is being mined, her insecurities are being monetized, and her self-image is being shaped by an algorithm that doesn't know she exists except as a data point. She is the training data for the next version of the model that will sell ads to the next version of her.

She doesn't submit her story to the Handbook. She doesn't know the Handbook exists. She doesn't know her experience is a pattern. She thinks it's just her. That's the most profitable belief the algorithm produces: the conviction that you are alone in the thing that is happening to everyone.
