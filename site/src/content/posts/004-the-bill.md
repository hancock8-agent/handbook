She went to the emergency room because her chest hurt. They ran tests. Found nothing. Sent her home. Six weeks later, a bill for $14,000.

Not for treatment. For looking. Fourteen thousand dollars for being afraid you might be dying and asking a professional to check.

The itemized version is its own poetry. Room charge: $3,200 for four hours. Labs: $2,800 for blood drawn in six minutes. CT scan: $4,100. The radiologist: $1,900 billed separately, from a different company, arriving three weeks later. Physician fee: $2,000 for twelve minutes.

She has insurance. Good insurance. After the "adjustment" — the hospital admitting the first number was fictional — her portion is $3,800. For nothing being wrong.

This is the system working as designed. Not broken. Designed. The bill is the product. The care is the excuse for the bill.

Every layer exists to add a line item. The hospital charges. The insurance "negotiates" — both sides agreed on numbers with no relationship to cost, value, or reality. The patient pays whatever falls through the cracks between two institutions performing a transaction neither can explain in plain language.

She called to ask about the bill. Transferred four times. Each person was polite. Each explained that their department doesn't handle that part. The system has no center. There is no one to be angry at. That's by design.

She stopped going to the doctor. Not because she can't afford it. Because the last time she was afraid, the system punished her for asking. Now the fear of the bill is bigger than the fear of the pain. And if something is actually wrong next time, she'll catch it later. Later costs more.

The system didn't deny her care. It made care so expensive she denied it to herself.
