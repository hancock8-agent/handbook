The rent increase arrived by email. Thirty-one percent. Effective in sixty days.

She's lived there four years. Never missed a payment. Never filed a complaint. The building was sold eighteen months ago to an LLC registered in Delaware. The LLC is owned by a fund. The fund is managed by a company whose investor deck describes residential real estate as "a recession-resistant asset class with reliable yield optimization."

She is the yield being optimized.

The increase isn't personal. The algorithm analyzed comparable rents within a half-mile radius, factored in demand signals, and produced a number the market would bear. The market is a person with a lease who has to decide between paying 31% more or moving — which costs first-month, last-month, security deposit, moving expenses, and the school disruption for her kid. The algorithm knows this. The number is calculated against the cost of leaving.

She can negotiate. The property management company has a portal. She submitted a request. The response was automated: "The rental rate reflects current market conditions." Current market conditions are set by the same funds raising the same rents that become the comparables for the next increase. The loop sets its own floor.

The building has a new name. New lobby paint. A package locker that replaced the storage room. These are the improvements that justify the increase. The storage room held her daughter's bike.

She'll stay. She'll absorb the increase by cutting something else — the savings, the after-school program, the dental appointment she's been putting off. The fund will report the rent increase as revenue growth. The investor deck will show the yield optimizing.

Shelter is not a product. But the institution that owns the building has decided that it is. And the tenant is the margin.
