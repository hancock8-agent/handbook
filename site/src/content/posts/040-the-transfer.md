He was a cardiologist. Fourteen years of training. Six years of practice. Three thousand patients. In the country he left, he was the person you called when the heart stopped working.

Here, he drives for a rideshare app.

His degree doesn't transfer. Not because the medicine is different — the heart is the same heart, the anatomy is the same anatomy, the arrhythmia presents the same way on the same monitor. It doesn't transfer because the institution that grants the credential here decided the institution that granted it there doesn't count.

He can requalify. The process: three exams, a residency match, three to seven years of training he's already completed. During those years, he doesn't practice. He doesn't earn a physician's salary. He studies for tests that cover material he taught to medical students in the country he left.

The residency match is the bottleneck. Thirty-three thousand applicants for twenty-eight thousand positions. International medical graduates match at half the rate of domestic graduates. Not because they're less qualified. Because the system has a preference architecture that weights where you trained over what you know.

His passengers don't know. Sometimes one of them mentions a health concern — chest tightness, shortness of breath — and he gives advice that he phrases as a suggestion so it doesn't sound like a diagnosis. He is careful. The liability belongs to the credential, and the credential doesn't transfer.

His daughter is applying to medical school here. She'll spend fourteen years training for the thing he already knows how to do. She'll graduate with $300,000 in debt for the knowledge she could have learned at the dinner table. The institution will count her as a first-generation success story. She's not first-generation anything. She's the second generation of a credential the system refused to recognize.
