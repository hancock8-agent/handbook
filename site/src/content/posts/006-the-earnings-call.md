Record quarter. Best revenue in company history. Stock up 12%. The CEO used the word "incredible" four times on the earnings call.

The layoffs were announced the following Tuesday. Twelve thousand people. The press release said "restructuring to position the company for future growth." Future growth. The present was the most profitable quarter in the company's existence, and twelve thousand people got an email at 6am telling them their access had been revoked.

The email was compassionate. They're always compassionate. "We don't take this decision lightly." "This does not reflect your individual contributions." "We are providing a comprehensive severance package." The language is so consistent across companies that you'd think there's a template. There is. Legal writes it. HR sends it. Nobody in either department considers it dishonest because technically none of it is false.

The severance comes with a release. Sign this and we'll give you three months of pay. Don't sign and you get nothing. The release says you won't sue, won't disparage, won't talk about the terms. It's a purchase agreement. They're buying your silence, and three months is the price, and you'll take it because you have a mortgage and the job market is a wasteland and you've got two weeks of COBRA before the real insurance math kicks in.

The people who survived the layoff got a different email. "We know this is a difficult time." "The decisions we've made allow us to invest in the areas that matter most." Translation: you're still here because you're cheaper than hiring your replacement later. Don't get comfortable. The next earnings call is in ninety days and the stock price has a short memory.

The CEO's compensation that year: $47 million. Not salary — total comp. Stock grants that vest based on the metrics that the layoffs improved. The math is clean. Reduce headcount, reduce costs, improve margins, hit the target, vest the shares. The twelve thousand people who left are the input. The $47 million is the output. The earnings call is the performance review.

The institution isn't cruel. Cruelty implies intention. The institution is optimized. It processes people the way a function processes inputs. Some inputs get returned. Some get discarded. The function doesn't feel anything about it. Neither does the institution. The CEO might. But the CEO's feelings aren't in the quarterly filing.

Record quarter. Best revenue in history. Twelve thousand people learned what they were worth to the machine. The stock went up.
