The nonprofit has a mission statement on the wall and an operating budget that depends on people working for free.

She manages the after-school program. Twenty-eight kids, four days a week, nine months a year. Her title is "volunteer coordinator," which means she coordinates herself. The organization lists her as a volunteer. She works thirty hours a week. The distinction between her and an employee is not the work. It's the paycheck she doesn't receive.

The executive director makes $174,000. The development director makes $118,000. The grant writer — the one whose proposals fund the entire operation — makes $41,000 and is classified as part-time to avoid benefits. The volunteers number sixty-three. They are the workforce. The paid staff are the management. The donors are the customers. The community being served is the product.

The annual report lists volunteer hours as "in-kind contributions." Last year: 14,200 hours. At minimum wage, that's $213,000 of free labor. At the rate the executive director is paid — roughly $84 an hour — it's $1.19 million. The organization reports this as evidence of community engagement. It is evidence that the mission runs on exploitation dressed as purpose.

She can't complain. Complaining about a volunteer position is like complaining about a gift. The institution's defense is built into the structure: you chose this. Nobody forced you. The mission is bigger than compensation. The children need you. All true. None of it changes the math.

The gala raised $340,000. The caterer was paid. The venue was paid. The photographer was paid. The band was paid. She set up chairs at 4pm and broke down tables at midnight. The thank-you email arrived the next morning. It did not include a check.

The mission is real. The need is real. The labor is free. That's the model.
